## Testing

If you're making functional changes, test them before opening a pull request.

## Submitting changes

Open a pull request with a clear list of what you've done. Follow the coding
conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine
for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it.

* Indent using four spaces
* Put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`),
  around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`).
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code,
  and make it look nice for them.
* TODO: write the rest of this
